## Remote Learning Tips

1. **Follow the session order** - Each session builds on the previous one
2. **Do homework exercises** - They're essential for understanding
3. **Present to yourself** - Explain concepts out loud (Feynman technique)
4. **Document your work** - Keep all exercise solutions for review
5. **Use the file links** - Click through to see complete solutions
